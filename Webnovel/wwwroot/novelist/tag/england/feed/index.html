				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:</p>
<p>Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say, dear?&#8221; said my wife, looking across at me. &#8220;Will you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.&#8221; My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap. &#8220;It is really very good of you to come, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack. &#8220;Have you heard anything of the case?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds a little paradoxical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a murder, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighboring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighborhood. McCarthy kept two servantsâ€”a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that I allude to them. For a long time, even with the utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make the facts public, but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. It records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The reader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence.</p>
<p>We had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six o&#8217;clock on a cold, frosty winter&#8217;s evening. As Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. I picked it up and read:</p>
<p>CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON, Appledore Towers, Hampstead. Agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;The worst man in London,&#8221; Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire. &#8220;Is anything on the back of the card?&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will call at 6:30 &#8212; C.A.M.,&#8221; I read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! He&#8217;s about due. Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation, Watson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo, and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces? Well, that&#8217;s how Milverton impresses me. I&#8217;ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can&#8217;t get out of doing business with him &#8212; indeed, he is here at my invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come into the power of Milverton! With a smiling face and a heart of marble, he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade. His method is as follows: He allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth and position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians, who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard hand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was the result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning. I have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how could one compare the ruffian, who in hot blood bludgeons his mate, with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months&#8217; imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. If ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then indeed we should have him, but he is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no, we must find other ways to fight him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why is he here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands. It is the Lady Eva Blackwell, the most beautiful debutante of last season. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt. This fiend has several imprudent letters &#8212; imprudent, Watson, nothing worse &#8212; which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country. They would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been commissioned to meet him, and &#8212; to make the best terms I can.&#8221;</p>
