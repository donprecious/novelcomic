		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/09/01/romeo-juliet/"><![CDATA[<p>The two chief families in Verona were the rich Capulets and the Montagues. There had been an old quarrel between these families, which was grown to such a height, and so deadly was the enmity between them, that it extended to the remotest kindred, to the followers and retainers of both sides, in so much that a servant of the house of Montague could not meet a servant of the house of Capulet, nor a Capulet encounter with a Montague by chance, but fierce words and sometimes bloodshed ensued; and frequent were the brawls from such accidental meetings, which disturbed the happy quiet of Verona&#8217;s streets.</p>
<p>Old Lord Capulet made a great supper, to which many fair ladies and many noble guests were invited. All the admired beauties of Verona were present, and all comers were made welcome if they were not of the house of Montague. At this feast of Capulets, Rosaline, beloved of Romeo, son to the old Lord Montague, was present; and though it was dangerous for a Montague to be seen in this assembly, yet Benvolio, a friend of Romeo, persuaded the young lord to go to this assembly in the disguise of a mask, that he might see his Rosaline, and, seeing her, compare her with some choice beauties of Verona, who (he said) would make him think his swan a crow. Romeo had small faith in Benvolio&#8217;s words; nevertheless, for the love of Rosaline, he was persuaded to go. For Romeo was a sincere and passionate lover, and one that lost his sleep for love and fled society to be alone, thinking on Rosaline, who disdained him and never requited his love with the least show of courtesy or affection; and Benvolio wished to cure his friend of this love by showing him diversity of ladies and company. To this feast of Capulets, then, young Romeo, with Benvolio and their friend Mercutio, went masked. Old Capulet bid them welcome and told them that ladies who had their toes unplagued with corns would dance with them. And the old man was light-hearted and merry, and said that he had worn a mask when he was young and could have told a whispering tale in a fair lady&#8217;s ear. And they fell to dancing, and Romeo was suddenly struck with the exceeding beauty of a lady who danced there, who seemed to him to teach the torches to burn bright, and her beauty to show by night like a rich jewel worn by a blackamoor; beauty too rich for use, too dear for earth! like a snowy dove trooping with crows (he said), so richly did her beauty and perfections shine above the ladies her companions. While he uttered these praises he was overheard by Tybalt, a nephew of Lord Capulet, who knew him by his voice to be Romeo. And this Tybalt, being of a fiery and passionate temper, could not endure that a Montague should come under cover of a mask, to fleer and scorn (as he said) at their solemnities. And he stormed and raged exceedingly, and would have struck young Romeo dead. But his uncle, the old Lord Capulet, would not suffer him to do any injury at that time, both out of respect to his guests and because Romeo had borne himself like a gentleman and all tongues in Verona bragged of him to be a virtuous and well-governed youth. Tybalt, forced to be patient against his will, restrained himself, but swore that this vile Montague should at another time dearly pay for his intrusion.</p>
<p>The dancing being done, Romeo watched the place where the lady stood; and under favor of his masking habit, which might seem to excuse in part the liberty, he presumed in the gentlest manner to take her by the hand, calling it a shrine, which if he profaned by touching it, he was a blushing pilgrim and would kiss it for atonement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good pilgrim,&#8221; answered the lady, &#8220;your devotion shows by far too mannerly and too courtly. Saints have hands which pilgrims may touch but kiss not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have not saints lips, and pilgrims, too?&#8221; said Romeo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;lips which they must use in prayer.&#8221;</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/08/26/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-6/"><![CDATA[<p>When we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich, and the air was full of the joyousness of early summer. Just as we were about to depart, Herr Delbruck (the maitre d&#8217;hotel of the Quatre Saisons, where I was staying) came down bareheaded to the carriage and, after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still holding his hand on the handle of the carriage door, &#8220;Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is a shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm. But I am sure you will not be late.&#8221; Here he smiled and added, &#8220;for you know what night it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johann answered with an emphatic, &#8220;Ja, mein Herr,&#8221; and, touching his hat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after signalling to him to stop:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Johann, what is tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>He crossed himself, as he answered laconically: &#8220;Walpurgis nacht.&#8221; Then he took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as big as a turnip and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together and a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realized that this was his way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay and sank back in the carriage, merely motioning him to proceed. He started off rapidly, as if to make up for lost time. Every now and then the horses seemed to throw up their heads and sniff the air suspiciously. On such occasions I often looked round in alarm. The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of high windswept plateau. As we drove, I saw a road that looked but little used and which seemed to dip through a little winding valley. It looked so inviting that, even at the risk of offending him, I called Johann to stop &#8211; and when he had pulled up, I told him I would like to drive down that road. He made all sorts of excuses and frequently crossed himself as he spoke. This somewhat piqued my curiosity, so I asked him various questions. He answered fencingly and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest.</p>
<p>Finally I said, &#8220;Well, Johann, I want to go down this road. I shall not ask you to come unless you like; but tell me why you do not like to go, that is all I ask.&#8221; For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so quickly did he reach the ground. Then he stretched out his hands appealingly to me and implored me not to go. There was just enough of English mixed with the German for me to understand the drift of his talk. He seemed always just about to tell me something &#8211; the very idea of which evidently frightened him; but each time he pulled himself up saying, &#8220;Walpurgis nacht!&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man when I did not know his language. The advantage certainly rested with him, for although he began to speak in English, of a very crude and broken kind, he always got excited and broke into his native tongue &#8211; and every time he did so, he looked at his watch. Then the horses became restless and sniffed the air. At this he grew very pale, and, looking around in a frightened way, he suddenly jumped forward, took them by the bridles, and led them on some twenty feet. I followed and asked why he had done this. For an answer he crossed himself, pointed to the spot we had left, and drew his carriage in the direction of the other road, indicating a cross, and said, first in German, then in English, &#8220;Buried him &#8211; him what killed themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remembered the old custom of burying suicides at cross roads: &#8220;Ah! I see, a suicide. How interesting!&#8221; But for the life of me I could not make out why the horses were frightened.</p>
<p>Whilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless, and it took Johann all his time to quiet them. He was pale and said, &#8220;It sounds like a wolf &#8211; but yet there are no wolves here now.&#8221; &#8220;No?&#8221; I said, questioning him. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it long since the wolves were so near the city?&#8221;</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/07/25/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-5/"><![CDATA[<p>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:</p>
<p>Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say, dear?&#8221; said my wife, looking across at me. &#8220;Will you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.&#8221; My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap. &#8220;It is really very good of you to come, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack. &#8220;Have you heard anything of the case?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds a little paradoxical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a murder, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighboring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighborhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/06/25/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-4/"><![CDATA[<p>It is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that I allude to them. For a long time, even with the utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make the facts public, but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. It records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The reader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence.</p>
<p>We had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six o&#8217;clock on a cold, frosty winter&#8217;s evening. As Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. I picked it up and read:</p>
<p>CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON, Appledore Towers, Hampstead. Agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;The worst man in London,&#8221; Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire. &#8220;Is anything on the back of the card?&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will call at 6:30 &#8212; C.A.M.,&#8221; I read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! He&#8217;s about due. Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation, Watson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo, and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces? Well, that&#8217;s how Milverton impresses me. I&#8217;ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can&#8217;t get out of doing business with him &#8212; indeed, he is here at my invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come into the power of Milverton! With a smiling face and a heart of marble, he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade. His method is as follows: He allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth and position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians, who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard hand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was the result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning. I have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how could one compare the ruffian, who in hot blood bludgeons his mate, with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months&#8217; imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. If ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then indeed we should have him, but he is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no, we must find other ways to fight him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why is he here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands. It is the Lady Eva Blackwell, the most beautiful debutante of last season. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt. This fiend has several imprudent letters &#8212; imprudent, Watson, nothing worse &#8212; which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country. They would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been commissioned to meet him, and &#8212; to make the best terms I can.&#8221;</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/05/25/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-3/"><![CDATA[<p>In the days when everybody started fair, Best Beloved, the Leopard lived in a place called the High Veldt. &#8216;Member it wasn&#8217;t the Low Veldt, or the Bush Veldt, or the Sour Veldt, but the &#8216;sclusively bare, hot shiny High Veldt, where there was sand and sandy-coloured rock and &#8216;sclusively tufts of sandy-yellowish grass. The Giraffe and the Zebra and the Eland and the Koodoo and the Hartebeest lived there: and they were &#8216;sclusively sandy-yellow-brownish all over; but the Leopard, he was the &#8216;sclusivest sandiest-yellowest-brownest of them all &#8212; a greyish-yellowish catty-shaped kind of beast, and he matched the &#8216;sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish colour of the High Veldt to one hair. This was very bad for the Giraffe and the Zebra and the rest of them: for he would lie down by a &#8216;sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish stone or clump of grass, and when the Giraffe or the Zebra or the Eland or the Koodoo or the Bush-Buck or the Bonte-Buck came by he would surprise them out of their jumpsome lives. He would indeed! And, also, there was an Ethiopian with bows and arrows (a &#8216;sclusively greyish-brownish-yellowish man he was then), who lived on the High Veldt with the Leopard: and the two used to hunt together &#8212; the Ethiopian with his bows and arrows, and the Leopard &#8216;sclusively with his teeth and claws &#8212; till the Giraffe and the Eland and the Koodoo and the Quagga and all the rest of them didn&#8217;t know which way to jump, Best Beloved. They didn&#8217;t indeed!</p>
<p>After a long time &#8212; things lived for ever so long in those days &#8212; they learned to avoid anything that looked like a Leopard or an Ethiopian: and bit by bit &#8212; the Giraffe began it, because his legs were the longest &#8212; they went away from the High Veldt. They scuttled for days and days till they came to a great forest, &#8216;sclusively full of trees and bushes and stripy, speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows, and there they hid: and after another long time, what with standing half in the shade and half out of it, and what with the slippery-slidy shadows of the trees falling on them, the Giraffe grew blotchy, and the Zebra grew stripy, and the Eland and the Koodoo grew darker, with little wavy grey lines on their backs like bark on a tree-trunk: and so, though you could hear them and smell them, you could very seldom see them, and then only when you knew precisely where to look. They had a beautiful time in the &#8216;sclusively speckly-spickly shadows of the forest, while the Leopard and the Ethiopian ran about over the &#8216;sclusively greyish-yellowish-reddish High Veldt outside, wondering where all their breakfasts and their dinners and their teas had gone. At last they were so hungry that they ate rats and beetles and rock-rabbits, the Leopard and the Ethiopian, and then they had the Big Tummy-ache, both together: and then they met Baviaan &#8212; the dog-headed, barking baboon, who is Quite the Wisest Animal in All South Africa.</p>
<p>Said the Leopard to Baviaan (and it was a very hot day), &#8216;Where has all the game gone?&#8217;</p>
<p>And Baviaan winked. He knew.</p>
<p>Said Ethiopian to Baviaan, &#8216;Can you tell me the present habitat of the aboriginal Fauna?&#8217; (That meant just the same thing, but the Ethiopian always used long words. He was a grown-up.)</p>
<p>And Baviaan winked. He knew.</p>
<p>Then said Baviaan, &#8216;The game has gone into other spots: and my advice to you, Leopard, is to go into other spots as soon as you can.&#8217;</p>
<p>And the Ethiopian said, &#8216;That is all very fine, but I wish to know whither the aboriginal Fauna has migrated.&#8217;</p>
<p>Then said Baviaan, &#8216;The aboriginal Fauna has joined the aboriginal Flora because it was high time for a change; and my advice to you, Ethiopian, is to change as soon as you can.&#8217;</p>
<p>That puzzled the Leopard and the Ethiopian, but they set off to look for the aboriginal Flora, and presently, after ever so many days, they saw a great, high, tall forest full of tree-trunks all &#8216;sclusively speckled and sprottled and spottled, dotted and splashed and slashed and hatched and cross-hatched with shadows. (Say that quickly aloud, and you will see how very shadowy the forest must have been.)</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/04/25/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-2/"><![CDATA[<p>There was a woman who was beautiful, who started with all the advantages, yet she had no luck. She married for love, and the love turned to dust. She had bonny children, yet she felt they had been thrust upon her, and she could not love them. They looked at her coldly, as if they were finding fault with her. And hurriedly she felt she must cover up some fault in herself. Yet what it was that she must cover up she never knew. Nevertheless, when her children were present, she always felt the centre of her heart go hard. This troubled her, and in her manner she was all the more gentle and anxious for her children, as if she loved them very much. Only she herself knew that at the centre of her heart was a hard little place that could not feel love, no, not for anybody. Everybody else said of her: &#8220;She is such a good mother. She adores her children.&#8221; Only she herself, and her children themselves, knew it was not so. They read it in each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>There were a boy and two little girls. They lived in a pleasant house, with a garden, and they had discreet servants, and felt themselves superior to anyone in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Although they lived in style, they felt always an anxiety in the house. There was never enough money. The mother had a small income, and the father had a small income, but not nearly enough for the social position which they had to keep up. The father went into town to some office. But though he had good prospects, these prospects never materialised. There was always the grinding sense of the shortage of money, though the style was always kept up.</p>
<p>At last the mother said: &#8220;I will see if I can&#8217;t make something.&#8221; But she did not know where to begin. She racked her brains, and tried this thing and the other, but could not find anything successful. The failure made deep lines come into her face. Her children were growing up, they would have to go to school. There must be more money, there must be more money. The father, who was always very handsome and expensive in his tastes, seemed as if he never would be able to do anything worth doing. And the mother, who had a great belief in herself, did not succeed any better, and her tastes were just as expensive.</p>
<p>And so the house came to be haunted by the unspoken phrase: There must be more money! There must be more money! The children could hear it all the time though nobody said it aloud. They heard it at Christmas, when the expensive and splendid toys filled the nursery. Behind the shining modern rocking-horse, behind the smart doll&#8217;s house, a voice would start whispering: &#8220;There must be more money! There must be more money!&#8221; And the children would stop playing, to listen for a moment. They would look into each other&#8217;s eyes, to see if they had all heard. And each one saw in the eyes of the other two that they too had heard. &#8220;There must be more money! There must be more money!&#8221;</p>
<p>It came whispering from the springs of the still-swaying rocking-horse, and even the horse, bending his wooden, champing head, heard it. The big doll, sitting so pink and smirking in her new pram, could hear it quite plainly, and seemed to be smirking all the more self-consciously because of it. The foolish puppy, too, that took the place of the teddy-bear, he was looking so extraordinarily foolish for no other reason but that he heard the secret whisper all over the house: &#8220;There must be more money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet nobody ever said it aloud. The whisper was everywhere, and therefore no one spoke it. Just as no one ever says: &#8220;We are breathing!&#8221; in spite of the fact that breath is coming and going all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said the boy Paul one day, &#8220;why don&#8217;t we keep a car of our own? Why do we always use uncle&#8217;s, or else a taxi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we&#8217;re the poor members of the family,&#8221; said the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why are we, mother?&#8221;</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://themes.themolitor.com/wpnovelist/2011/03/25/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet/"><![CDATA[<p>The red death had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&#8211;the madness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress, and termination of the disease, were incidents of half an hour.</p>
<p>But Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his crenellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince&#8217;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.</p>
<p>They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &#8220;Red Death.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>
<p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven&#8211;an imperial suite, In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extant is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke&#8217;s love of the &#8220;bizarre.&#8221; The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor of which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue&#8211;and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange&#8211;the fifth with white&#8211;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes were scarlet&#8211;a deep blood color. Now in no one of any of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro and depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly lit the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or back chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all. It was within this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. It pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and while the chimes of the clock yet rang. it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before. But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for color and effects. He disregarded the &#8220;decora&#8221; of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_ he was not.</p>
